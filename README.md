For V2 to allow users to create multiple playlists, I would create a new table called user_playlist with columns user_id and playlist_id. This table would represent a many-to-many relationship between users and playlists. Users can have multiple playlists and each playlist can belong to multiple users (in case the app allows for collaborative playlists).
To implement multiple account types with different privileges, I would add a new column to the users table called account_type with a data type of ENUM and the options of "free", "standard", and "premium". This column would allow the app to determine which features are available to each user based on their account type. If additional account types are added in the future, the ENUM can be updated to include those options.
To migrate the schema for v2, we would likely need to add a new column to the users table to store the user's account type, and modify the playlists table to allow for multiple playlists per user. The playlist_songs table would also need to be modified to include the playlist ID as well as the user ID. Finally, we would need to modify any queries or code that rely on the previous schema to accommodate the changes.
